***The webpage is not going to be responsive. So, it's best to open this webpage in desktop size device***

## Working process


   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First vital condition of this work is. The webpage has a tight time limit. And in order to achieved the expecting result in due time. I did some quick sketching and planning the idea of how the layout going to turns out to be.

I was planning to use vanilla HTML,CSS,JS. With the help of bootstrap to managing the layout. And getting to work on it a day after.

          
            




- 1st hour

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time to start, I spent the first hours setting up the project and taking any asset i need from the provided files. Mainly a fonts and image from ps file.

- 2nd hour

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second hours is all about doing by the plan. However using bootstrap grid layout to saving time is trade with some inaccuracies. The webpage may not 100% match with the design. And the HTML file may clustered with bootstrap class.

- 3rd hour

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third hour in. I've managed to complete the "overall" look of the whole webpage. Without any js script involved. So some animation are not working as expected. I've dropped the work to continue tomorrow for now. And this is what 3 hour of work looks like.

I'm also need to initing a git repository and sending the first update after this.


 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next task is to finising up the webpage. Add some button functionality and animation as brief stated, Refactoring/ polishing a layout would also be great. And all the other stuff i've mentioned are the most time consuming task in my usual work process. 

 - 4th hour to ~8 hour

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this point. My working time is now discontinuous. I'm polishing the page as stated. The webpage would be better the more time i get. And I decided to stop it there. After 8 hours. The work is now complete. There are some minor stuff to be done but it's working fine for now.

You can take a look at the robust css layout. There's no space to be wasted.
